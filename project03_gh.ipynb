    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "An investigation was conducted to analyze clients' behaviour and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue by studying data from the telecom operator Megaline.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were no missing or duplicate values identified for the phone calls, text messaging, and internet usage datasets. The *churn_date* variable looked to be problematic since it would mean that the sample size gets decreased by 34 people. However, those people were not removed and whatever data was collected will be considered for analysis since it is likely that they paid for one of the two services during their enrollment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values of 0 for the phone calls and internet usage datasets exist and could indicate that a phone call was less than one minute in duration (since the telecom company measures call duration in minutes), and a value of 0 in the internet usage dataset (in megabytes) could indicate that the internet was not used at all; these values were still included in analysis for comparison with other services. Datasets that have object-type dates were converted to datetime-type, and the column *month* was created in the phone call, text messaging, and internet traffic datasets to determine the particular month a service event occurred for the respective services as well as plan to indicate the type of service plan a specific user has purchased. Additionally for the phone call dataset, the column *duration_rounded* was created to round up phone call duration per the telecom company guidelines. Web traffic is charged for the entire month and rounded up to the nearest gigabyte which is reflected in *gb_rounded* for the internet dataset. The individual services were then aggregated into one dataset in addition to the *users_data* in order to exhibit the specific users and their telecom plan where the certain columns were renamed for practicality. Upon merging the datasets by *user_id* and/or *month*, missing values were produced and logically replaced with 0. There were 10 value counts (10 user ID’s) in *month* where there was a missing value which coincidentally had missing values for *gb_used*, *texts*, *calls*, and *minutes* and was removed as a result. The monthly revenue (*revenue*) was then calculated per the respective telecom plans (Surf or Ultimate) according to the telecom company's guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis was conducted on individual services (ie. phone call duration, text messages sent, and data usage) between Surf and Ultimate telecom plans and it was observed that on average, users from both Surf and Ultimate make phone calls that last around 430 minutes. There also seems to be more Ultimate users that utilize the phone call service than Surf users as well as a higher chance for an Ultimate user to make a phone call that is between 400-500 minutes compared to Surf users having phone calls that are between 300-450 minutes. Surf users on average send around 31 text messages and Ultimate users send around 38 text messages. There also seems to be more Ultimate users that utilize the text messaging service than Surf users and the data shows a higher chance for an Ultimate user to send between 0-20 text messages, and for Surf users there is a high chance people send between 0-25 text messages. As for internet usage, both Surf and Ultimate users use on average around 17 gb of data. There seems to be more Surf users than Ultimate users, however, there is a higher chance for an Ultimate user to be using between 15-19 gb of data compared to Surf users who will most likely use between 15-20 gb of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data, the Ultimate plan evidently brings in more revenue as well as users not from the NY-NJ region. However, to further determine whether this case is statistically significant, two queries were presented with regards to the average revenue accrued from users of Ultimate and Surf calling plans as well as from users in the NY-NJ area and other regions. An alpha value of 0.05 was used for both hypothesis tests since it is the most commonly used statistical significance level. For the first hypothesis test, an analysis was conducted to see if the average revenue accrued is equal from users of Ultimate and Surf calling plans ($H_{0}$) or that the average revenue from users of Ultimate calling plan is not equal to the average revenue from users of Surf calling plan ($H_{a}$). The analysis yielded a p-value of approximately 3.17e-15 (a very small number), which is less than 0.05, thus we reject $H_{0}$ and determine that the average revenue from users of Ultimate calling plan is not equal to the average revenue from users of Surf calling plan. For the second hypothesis test, an analysis was conducted to see if the average revenue accrued is not different from users in the NY-NJ area and other regions ($H_{0}$) or that the average revenue accrued is different from users in the NY-NJ area and other regions ($H_{a}$). The analysis yielded a p-value of approximately 0.034, which is less than 0.05, therefore we reject $H_{0}$ for this analysis as well and determine that the average revenue accrued is different from users in the NY-NJ area and other regions."

    "Upon looking at the general information for the data given, there are no discernible missing values in any of the datasets. The *churn_date* variable consists of 34 people who stopped using the telecom company's service and looks to be problematic since it would mean that the sample size gets decreased. However, those 34 individuals will not be removed and whatever data was collected will be considered for analysis since it is likely that they paid for one of the two services during their enrollment. The telecom company has their particular way of measuring certain services (eg. call duration, web traffic) and so those calculations will be addressed below."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "No missing or duplicate values were identified for the phone calls, text messaging, and internet usage datasets. Be that as it may, there are values of 0 for the phone calls and internet usage datasets. A value of 0 in the phone calls dataset could indicate a call that was less than one minute in duration (since the telecom company measures call duration in minutes), and a value of 0 in the internet usage dataset (in megabytes) could indicate that the internet was not used at all. In consummation, these values will still be included in analysis for comparison with other services. Moreover, datasets that have object-type dates were converted to datetime-type. The column *month* was created in the phone call, text messaging, and internet traffic datasets to determine the particular month a service event occurred for the respective services. Additionally for the phone call dataset, the column *duration_rounded* was created to round up phone call duration per the telecom company guidelines. Web traffic is charged for the entire month and rounded up to the nearest gigabyte which is reflected in *gb_rounded* for the internet dataset. The individual services were then aggregated into one dataset in addition to the *users_data* in order to exhibit the specific users and their telecom plan where the following columns were renamed for practicality: the number of calls made is labelled as *calls*, *duration_rounded* is *minutes*, the number of text messages sent is *texts*, and *gb_rounded* is *gb_used*. Upon merging the datasets by *user_id* and/or *month*, missing values were produced. *NaN* values in *gb_used*, *texts*, *calls*, and *minutes* were logically replaced with 0. There were 10 value counts in *month* where there was a missing value. Coincidentally, where there were missing values in *month*, it corresponded to a specific user (10 user ID's) as well as having missing values in *gb_used*, *texts*, *calls*, and *minutes*. As a result, those 10 rows were removed from the dataset which leaves data for the other 490 users. The monthly revenue (*revenue*) was then calculated per the respective telecom plans (Surf or Ultimate) according to the telecom company's guidelines."
